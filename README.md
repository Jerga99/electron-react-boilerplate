# Welcome to CryptKeeper

1. First install dependencies: ```npm install``` </br>
2. In one terminal window run: ```npm run watch``` to compile react code <br/>
3. In other one run: ```npm start``` to start Electron app

## CryptKeeper Is an App

...that stores your passwords on an encrypted file called a cryptkeeper:  `<your_crypt>.cryptkeeper`.

It also stores user data for login to the app in an encrypted `.crypt` file.

The goal of CryptKeeper is to prevent any visibility of passwords, even to your system. You only need to log in, search for the password information you want, click the button to send it to your clipboard for a limited time, paste the password into a password field, and move on.

## Goals for CryptKeeper

Currently, CryptKeeper is under construction. The login screen is done, and the process of saving new encrypted passwords is underway. In the future, we'd like to encrypt any and all files with the click of a button (and of course, decrypt them too!).

Keep digging into our files for more info! Also, enjoy our wireframe, brainstorming, and conceptualization on our [Excalidraw board](https://excalidraw.com/#json=lMRG6wnrESPFP3FSUh69C,KvPnv7BSxvOCbzydT_wjMg)!
